## Summary
Do you hate parking in Atlanta? You are not alone. Current parking solutions have a poor UX, require login, have limited payment options and parking duration options, and high minimum costs to consumers. Wouldn't it be great if you could park easily and simply via a clean UX, not requiring login and paying using the lightning network instantly from anywhere? Enter Arion, Parking at the Speed of Lightning ⚡️
